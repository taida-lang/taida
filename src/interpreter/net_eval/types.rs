// ── C12-12 / FB-2: Body encoding internal representation ─────
//
// `BodyEncoding` names the three ways an HTTP/1.1 request can frame
// its body. It is derived from the parsed headers at handshake time
// and consumed by the runtime (read path, keep-alive advance,
// streaming state transitions).
//
// Intentionally *not* exposed in the handler-visible Taida
// `Value::BuchiPack`. The Taida surface continues to expose only
// the flattened `contentLength: Int` and `chunked: Bool` pair for v1
// compatibility. The `BodyEncoding` enum is the single source of
// truth that the internal wiring promotes to when v2 chunked /
// trailers / HTTP/2 DATA frames gain first-class support — see
// `.dev/taida-logs/docs/design/net_v2_chunked.md` for the upgrade
// path.
//
// Representation rules (matches RFC 7230 § 3.3.3):
//   - `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` present (alone) → `Chunked`
//   - `Content-Length: N` with N > 0 and no TE:chunked → `ContentLength(N)`
//   - `Content-Length: 0` and no TE:chunked → `Empty { had_content_length_header: true }`
//   - neither header present → `Empty { had_content_length_header: false }`
//   - TE:chunked + any `Content-Length` → rejected at parse time
//     (predates `BodyEncoding` construction), so this enum never has
//     to represent the invalid combination.
//
// C12B-032 refinement: the `Empty` variant now carries a
// `had_content_length_header` bit so the internal layer can
// distinguish between "the client sent `Content-Length: 0`" and
// "the client sent no Content-Length / Transfer-Encoding at all".
// Both cases still produce identical behaviour in the runtime read
// loop, but downstream consumers (v2 chunked trailers, HTTP/2 DATA
// frame framing, TE:identity negotiation) need the distinction to
// implement RFC 7230 § 3.3.3 rule 6 correctly. The handler-visible
// `contentLength: 0` / `chunked: false` flattening is preserved for
// v1 compatibility.
