//! best-effort terminal-state restoration on panic / fatal signal.
//!
//! Addons in the `taida-lang/terminal` family put the terminal into raw
//! mode, enter the alternate screen, hide the cursor, and enable mouse
//! reporting. When the host process (the `taida` CLI) panics or is
//! terminated by SIGHUP / SIGTERM / SIGQUIT / SIGABRT before the addon's
//! `leave_raw_mode()` can run, the shell is left with a corrupted
//! terminal (no echo, no cursor, alternate screen active).
//!
//! The frozen addon ABI v1 does not include a host-callback through
//! which an addon can register a drop guard, so the comprehensive fix
//! (an `on_panic_cleanup` entry on `TaidaHostV1`) is a breaking
//! change. For the `@c.25.rc*` cycle we install a **best-effort
//! fallback** inside the Taida CLI host itself that:
//!
//! 1. Registers a [`std::panic::set_hook`] chain that writes a
//! well-known ANSI reset sequence to stderr before forwarding to the
//! previous hook. The reset sequence unconditionally shows the
//! cursor, leaves the alternate screen, disables mouse reporting,
//! and emits a soft terminal reset (`ESC c`-class, but we use the
//! narrower `ESC[!p` DECSTR that does not wipe scrollback).
//!
//! 2. Installs signal handlers for SIGHUP / SIGTERM / SIGQUIT /
//! SIGABRT (UNIX only; a no-op stub on Windows so higher-level code
//! compiles unchanged) that do the same reset and then re-raise the
//! signal with the default disposition so the process exits with
//! the expected status code.
//!
//! 3. Remains a **no-op** when stderr is not a TTY. Non-interactive
//! CI invocations will not have their log output polluted with ANSI
//! escapes, and the hook's only cost is one syscall to `isatty(2)`
//! on panic.
//!
//! ## Scope boundaries
//!
//! - The hook lives in the host CLI, not in the `taida-lang/terminal`
//! addon. The terminal addon is maintained separately and is not changed
//! by this module.
//! - The hook does **not** attempt to restore the caller's `termios`
//! state. A future addition will add a dedicated `TaidaHostV1`
//! slot through which `raw_mode.rs` can register a saved `termios`
//! pointer; until then, the best the host can do is emit the ANSI
//! sequences above, which at minimum gets the user back to a usable
//! shell prompt even if `tcsetattr(3)` state remains partly dirty.
//! - SIGWINCH / SIGCONT and other non-terminal signals are not
//! handled — they are not produced by panic-like conditions and
//! don't require cleanup.
//!
//! The panic hook is installed by [`install_panic_cleanup_hook`],
//! which is idempotent (guarded by a [`std::sync::OnceLock`]) so
//! nested `cargo test` invocations or explicit `taida run … taida run`
//! chains only install one hook per process. The signal handler is
//! installed similarly via [`install_signal_cleanup_handlers`]
//! (UNIX only).
//!
//! Both functions are called unconditionally from `fn main()` at
//! process start, before `libc::signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)` so that the
//! SIGPIPE disposition established for `taida run... | head`
//! pipelines is unaffected.
