//! C25B-017: parser error recovery audit (FB-31 continuation).
//!
//! # Context
//!
//! C20-1 (ROOT-4 / ROOT-5) closed the silent-bug class where
//! `parse_error_ceiling` and `parse_cond_branch` would swallow subsequent
//! top-level statements. The fixes landed as rejection diagnostics
//! (`[E0303]`, `[E0304]`), so the dangerous syntax now surfaces as a
//! `ParseError` rather than an invisible AST mutation.
//!
//! The remaining audit surface is **error-recovery correctness**: after
//! the parser emits one `ParseError` and calls `self.synchronize()`, the
//! next call to `parse_statement()` must see a **consistent tokenizer
//! state**. Specifically:
//!
//!   1. `peek_kind()` and the underlying `tokens[pos]` are aligned.
//!   2. The recovery does not leave us mid-expression — we are at a
//!      fresh statement boundary (or EOF).
//!   3. Every subsequent top-level statement either parses to a
//!      `Statement` or produces its own `ParseError`. No silent skip.
//!   4. The emitted `Vec<ParseError>` count matches the number of
//!      broken statements in the source; not fewer, not more.
//!
//! These tests drive `taida::parser::parse` directly and assert on the
//! `(Program, Vec<ParseError>)` shape. They are a regression guard for
//! any future refactor of `synchronize()` / `parse_cond_branch` /
//! `parse_error_ceiling` that might leak tokens or drop statements.
