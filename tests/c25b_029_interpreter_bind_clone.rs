//! C25B-029 — interpreter `<=` deep-clone on locally-bound addon
//! `Value::Record` perf regression guard (Phase 5-F scope-reduced).
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Phase 5-F (C25_PROGRESS.md) started by exploring an
//! `HashMap<String, Arc<Value>>` environment to turn Ident lookups
//! into O(1) `Arc::clone` calls. The exploration revealed that without
//! also migrating `Value::List` / `Value::BuchiPack` to interior
//! `Arc<Vec<...>>` with copy-on-write, the outer `Rc::clone` plus
//! inner `Value::clone` combination is still a full deep-clone with no
//! net wall-clock improvement. The proper root-cause fix is the Value
//! interior-arc migration (tracked as 5-F2 in C25_PROGRESS.md), which
//! is out of scope for the current session and will land in a
//! dedicated follow-up or in D26.
//!
//! # What this test pins
//!
//! The minimal reproducer from `docs/smoke/_clone_probe.td` built
//! around a pure-Taida `Value::BuchiPack` containing a 4800-item
//! `Value::List` of cell-shaped BuchiPacks. Without the fix, a
//! chain of 11 `touch(p)` calls (each clones the outer pack's
//! cells reference) scales linearly with each additional call.
//!
//! We *intentionally* do **not** assert "fast" numbers here; the
//! blocker is still open. Instead the test:
//!   * validates the fixture *runs to completion at all* (it used
//!     to freeze for 17s per frame — still slow but bounded);
//!   * pins the shape of the final value so a regression in Append
//!     / BuchiPack field access surfaces loudly;
//!   * ships a `SLOW` annotation so a future Phase 5-F2 landing can
//!     flip this test to a hard latency gate without re-writing it.
