//! C27B-018 paired with C27B-028 (Round 2 wH): native arena leak
//! mitigation via the small-string freelist.
//!
//! Pre-fix: `taida_str_release` skipped pushing arena-allocated str
//! headers onto the freelist (`!taida_arena_contains(hdr)` guard) so
//! 16-1024 B str allocations leaked their arena slot forever and the
//! NET hot path grew RSS by ~82 MB/min (24h projection: 118 GB).
//!
//! Fix (Option A + freelist capacity check): the arena-skip guard is
//! removed so arena slots get pushed to the small-string freelist on
//! release; subsequent allocations re-use them. The push side stamps
//! the slot's aligned data-area capacity in `hdr[1]` and the alloc
//! side verifies the slot is large enough before reuse, so the
//! latent bucket-vs-aligned-size mismatch (which the original
//! arena-skip guard masked, and which would have surfaced as
//! C27B-028 corruption) is also fixed.
//!
//! This test runs the freelist recycle fixture in native and asserts
//! the program completes quickly. If the arena-skip guard regressed,
//! the loop would still complete (no corruption), but if the
//! capacity check regressed, the same-size bucket reuse would
//! overwrite adjacent slots and parity with the interpreter would
//! break. We therefore re-use the 3-backend parity assertion for the
//! invariant + add a wall-clock budget as a coarse leak guard.
